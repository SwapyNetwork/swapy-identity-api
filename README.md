# Swapy Identity API

Swapy Identity API aims to ease the interaction with Swapy financial identities. The current implementation was designed to be used on browsers and it provides methods to: 
  * Create personal and multi sig identities;
  * Manage identity's data on IPFS and Ethereum;
  * Forward transactions through a personal identity;
  * Create, sign and execute transactions on multi sig identities;
  * Decentralized attestation of identitiy's credentials on IPFS with QRCode for third-parties;

Check out our smart-contracts and Wiki for more details around the Swapy Identity Protocol.
